Gardens v2 is a modular governance framework that enables communities to create and manage multiple governance pools with customizable parameters and conviction voting mechanisms. Built on [Allo Protocol v2](https://allo.gitcoin.co/), Gardens is designed for bottom-up decision-making, pairing an enforceable community Covenant with flexible voting pools to securely allocate resources and signal sentiment.

### How It Works

Communities deploy a Garden — a shared governance space anchored by a Covenant that defines community values and norms. Within each Garden, members can create multiple governance pools, each serving a distinct purpose with its own parameters, token requirements, and voting mechanisms. Members stake governance tokens to signal support for proposals, with conviction accumulating over time until a funding threshold is met — no centralized vote required.

### Pool Types

- **Funding Pools**: Allocate funds from a shared token pool to proposals that meet conviction thresholds  
- **Signaling Pools**: Source community sentiment on both onchain and offchain decisions  
- **Streaming Pools**: Stream funds from a shared token pool to proposals based on their conviction.

### Voting Weight Systems

- **Token-weighted**: 1 token = 1 vote  
- **Fixed**: Equal voting power for all members  
- **Quadratic**: Voting weight = √(tokens staked)  
- **Capped**: 1 token = 1 vote up to a maximum threshold

### Architecture

Gardens v2 is built using Diamond Pattern (EIP-2535) smart contract architecture, enabling modular upgrades and unlocking future feature additions without contract size constraints. Contracts are deployed across five networks and integrate with Superfluid Protocol for streaming payment primitives.

### Traction

- 150+ communities created  
- 2,500+ unique community members  
- $200k+ allocated through funding proposals  
- $80k+ TVL across governance pools

### Roadmap

Active development is focused on mobile-first redesign, Streaming Conviction Voting (combining conviction voting with Superfluid streaming primitives), governance pool templates, and deeper ecosystem integrations to support mass adoption.
