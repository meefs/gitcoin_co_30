**Holographic Consensus** is a governance scalability mechanism developed by DAOstack that uses prediction markets to surface high-priority proposals for voter attention. The core insight is that most DAO members can't evaluate every proposal — so predictors stake tokens on which proposals they believe will pass, and boosted proposals receive focused community attention. This enables DAOs to process many proposals while maintaining decision quality.

## How It Works

1. **Proposals are submitted** — anyone can create a governance proposal
2. **Predictors stake on outcomes** — participants stake tokens predicting whether the proposal will pass or fail
3. **Boosting occurs** — when sufficient stake backs a proposal, it gets "boosted" to a faster decision track with lower quorum requirements
4. **Focused voting** — the community concentrates attention on boosted proposals
5. **Proposals resolve** — voting determines the outcome; correct predictors earn rewards, incorrect predictors lose stake
6. **Non-boosted proposals** follow a slower track requiring higher quorum

## Advantages

- Solves the scalability/quality tradeoff in DAO governance
- Aligns incentives — predictors are rewarded for correctly identifying community preferences
- Reduces voter fatigue — attention is concentrated on proposals most likely to pass
- Enables high throughput — many proposals can be processed simultaneously
- Filters noise — low-quality proposals don't attract predictor stake

## Limitations

- Complex mechanism that is difficult for participants to understand
- Prediction market dynamics can be manipulated by wealthy actors
- Boosted proposals may not represent genuine community priorities if predictors are wrong
- Requires a liquid prediction market — low participation reduces effectiveness
- Pre-selects which proposals get attention, potentially filtering out important minority views

## Best Used When

- A DAO must process many proposals but voter attention is scarce
- Prediction market infrastructure exists and participants understand staking
- Scalable decision-making is more important than maximizing deliberation
- The community is large enough to sustain both predictor and voter roles

## Examples and Use Cases

**DAOstack's Alchemy** was the primary implementation of holographic consensus, used by several DAOs including dxDAO to manage high volumes of governance proposals with limited voter attention.

**Genesis DAO** used holographic consensus for its own governance, processing hundreds of proposals for funding and organizational decisions.
