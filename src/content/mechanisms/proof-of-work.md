**Proof-of-Work (PoW)** is a coordination mechanism where participants expend computational resources to solve cryptographic puzzles, earning the right to append blocks to a shared ledger and receive rewards. As a coordination mechanism, PoW solves the fundamental problem of achieving consensus among untrusted parties — computational cost replaces institutional trust, enabling decentralized coordination at global scale.

## How It Works

1. **Miners compete** — participants race to solve a computationally difficult but easily verifiable puzzle
2. **The winner proposes a block** — the first miner to solve the puzzle creates a new block of transactions
3. **The network validates** — other nodes verify the solution and the block's contents
4. **The block is appended** — valid blocks are added to the chain, becoming part of the shared state
5. **Rewards are distributed** — the winning miner receives newly minted tokens (block reward) plus transaction fees
6. **Difficulty adjusts** — the puzzle difficulty adapts to maintain consistent block times regardless of total compute power

## Advantages

- Sybil-resistant — creating fake identities doesn't help without proportional computational investment
- Permissionless — anyone with hardware can participate
- Battle-tested — Bitcoin has operated continuously since 2009
- Thermodynamic security — the physical cost of mining makes attacks expensive and measurable
- Simple consensus — longest chain rule provides clear fork resolution

## Limitations

- Enormous energy consumption — environmental cost scales with network value
- Centralizes around specialized hardware (ASICs) and cheap energy sources
- Wasteful by design — computational effort produces nothing beyond consensus
- Economies of scale favor large mining operations over individual participants
- Slow finality — probabilistic confirmation requires waiting multiple blocks

## Best Used When

- Maximum decentralization and censorship resistance are priorities
- Sybil resistance is needed without identity infrastructure
- The security model must be grounded in physical, unforgeable cost
- Simple, battle-tested consensus is preferred over newer mechanisms

## Examples and Use Cases

**Bitcoin** is the canonical proof-of-work system, securing the largest cryptocurrency network through competitive mining.

**Pre-merge Ethereum** used proof-of-work before transitioning to proof-of-stake in September 2022, demonstrating that networks can evolve beyond PoW.

**Hashcash** (1997) predated Bitcoin, using proof-of-work to combat email spam — each email required a small computational cost, making bulk spam economically infeasible.
