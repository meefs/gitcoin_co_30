**AutoPGF** eliminates governance friction by automating capital distribution to public goods. Rather than managing grants through traditional rounds or reviews, funds flow continuously or periodically based on predefined, objective signals — protocol fees, usage metrics, contribution data, or community votes.

## How It Works

AutoPGF replaces human allocation decisions with programmable, signal-driven fund flows.

1. **Establish funding source** — protocol revenue, treasury inflation, or dedicated allocation
2. **Define signals** — votes, contribution metrics, usage data, or oracle feeds that determine where funds flow
3. **Deploy distribution logic** — smart contracts that route funds based on signal inputs
4. **Funds flow automatically** — capital moves to qualified recipients based on real-time or periodic signal evaluation
5. **Optional safeguards** — governance can adjust parameters or add new recipients, but day-to-day distribution is automated

### Three Primary Models
- **Protocol-Native PGF**: A percentage of protocol fees automatically routes to public goods
- **Signal-Based Streaming**: Real-time fund flows determined by votes, contributions, or metrics
- **Trigger-Based Allocations**: Specific thresholds or conditions unlock new distributions

## Advantages

- Reduces governance and review overhead dramatically
- Provides consistent, predictable support for long-term contributors
- Creates transparent alignment between funding and measurable inputs
- Enables rule-based capital flows that don't depend on human attention

## Limitations

- Not suited for one-time or high-touch funding scenarios requiring judgment
- Cannot evaluate early-stage, untested contributors lacking historical data
- Struggles with creative/experimental projects that resist quantification
- Requires community consensus on which signals matter

## Best Used When

- Protocol DAOs want sustainable, hands-off public goods support
- Ecosystems have robust onchain activity and measurable metrics
- Treasury managers prefer automated allocation over repeated governance
- Builders need predictable, continuous funding rather than episodic grants

## Examples and Use Cases

### Protocol Fee Routing
Protocols route a percentage of transaction fees directly to ecosystem tools and infrastructure maintainers, based on usage metrics.

### Contribution-Based Distribution
DAOs distribute capital based on GitHub commits, documentation contributions, and community engagement metrics.

### Oracle-Monitored Infrastructure
Infrastructure projects receive automated funding based on uptime, usage volume, and performance data collected by oracles.
