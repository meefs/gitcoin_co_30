# Gitcoin 30 — Instructions for Claude

## Project Overview

A directory of public goods funding mechanisms, apps, campaigns, research, and case studies in the Ethereum ecosystem. Built with Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS v4, TypeScript.

## Content System

Markdown files live in `src/content/{apps,mechanisms,research,case-studies,campaigns}/`. Each file has YAML frontmatter followed by a markdown body.

### Directory Structure

```
src/content/
├── apps/           # Tools/platforms (Gitcoin Grants Stack, Juicebox, etc.)
├── mechanisms/     # Funding mechanisms (Quadratic Funding, Retroactive Funding, etc.)
├── research/       # Research articles and analysis
├── case-studies/   # Real-world case studies
└── campaigns/      # Funding rounds and campaigns
```

---

## Frontmatter Schemas

### Base fields (all content types)

```yaml
---
id: '1234567890'           # Unix timestamp string — use Date.now() when creating new files
slug: your-slug            # Kebab-case, must match the filename exactly
name: "Display Name"
shortDescription: "One-sentence description."
banner: /content-images/{category}/{slug}/banner.png   # Only if file exists — see Image Rules
tags:
  - tag-one
  - tag-two
lastUpdated: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
relatedMechanisms:
  - quadratic-funding
relatedApps:
  - gitcoin-grants-stack
relatedCaseStudies:
  - some-case-study-slug
relatedResearch:
  - some-research-slug
relatedCampaigns:
  - some-campaign-slug
---
```

> All five `related*` fields are parsed from frontmatter and rendered as related content sections on detail pages.

### Apps — additional fields

```yaml
logo: /content-images/apps/{slug}/logo.png   # Only if file exists — see Image Rules
featured: true                               # Optional — surfaces in featured section on /apps and homepage
```

Logo images for apps must be the **white/negative (inverted) version** of the app's logo. They are displayed on dark backgrounds — a full-colour logo will not render correctly.

### Research — additional field

```yaml
sensemakingFor: mechanisms   # Optional — marks this as the sensemaking article for a category page
                             # Valid values: mechanisms | apps | campaigns | case-studies | research
                             # Only one article per category should have this set
                             # Use a wider 3:1 banner (e.g. 1800×600px) for sensemaking articles

researchType: Report # Optional - can be Report | Opinion but not restricted to these values only
```

### Campaigns — additional fields

```yaml
featured: true                    # Optional — surfaces in featured section on /campaigns and homepage
externalUrl: 'https://...'        # Link to the campaign/round
matchingPoolUsd: '$1.5M'          # Total matching pool as a display string
projectsCount: '265'              # Number of projects as a display string
startDate: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
endDate: 'YYYY-MM-DD'             # Leave as empty string '' for ongoing campaigns
```

### featured field (all content types)

`featured: true` is available on every content type. What it does per type:
- **apps** → shown in featured section on `/apps` page and on the homepage
- **campaigns** → shown in featured section on `/campaigns` page and on the homepage
- **research** → shown in featured section on the homepage
- **mechanisms / case-studies** → loader supports it (featured items sort first) but no dedicated featured UI section exists yet

## Image Rules — Read Carefully

### NEVER add banner/logo frontmatter without the actual file

Do **not** write `banner: /content-images/research/my-article/banner.png` in frontmatter unless `public/content-images/research/my-article/banner.png` actually exists in the repository. A missing path breaks the page and OG image generation. When in doubt, omit the field — the app shows a placeholder automatically.

### No SVGs for banner or logo

Banners and logos are used as OG (Open Graph) images for social media previews. **SVG files cannot be used as OG images.** Always use **PNG or JPG** for `banner` and `logo`.

- If you have an SVG source, convert it to PNG before saving it.
- Inline description images may use any format, but PNG/JPG preferred.

### Logo style

App logos must be the **white/negative (inverted) version** — they are rendered on dark backgrounds. A full-colour or dark logo will not be visible.

### Image locations

```
public/content-images/
├── mechanisms/
│   └── quadratic-funding/
│       └── banner.jpg
├── apps/
│   └── gitcoin-grants-stack/
│       ├── banner.png
│       └── logo.png          # white/negative version, PNG only
├── research/
│   └── allo-protocol-ecosystem-analysis/
│       └── banner.png
├── case-studies/
│   └── some-case-study/
│       └── banner.png
├── campaigns/
│   └── gg24/
│       └── banner.png
└── placeholder.png           # fallback shown when no banner/logo is set
```

### Image dimensions

| Field | Dimensions | Aspect ratio |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| `banner` (standard) | 1600×900px or 1200×600px | 16:9 or 2:1 |
| `banner` (sensemaking article) | 1800×600px | 3:1 |
| `logo` | 256×256px or 512×512px | 1:1 square |

### Banner image generator

Two workflows depending on the situation:

**Batch / automatic** — generates banners for all content files that are missing one, fully automated. Requires a one-time browser install (`npx playwright install chromium`).

```bash
npm run banner:auto                          # all content types
npm run banner:auto mechanisms               # one content type
npm run banner:auto mechanisms quadratic-funding  # single item
```

Finds every `.md` file without a `banner:` field, generates a banner using the real Chladni Particles generator headlessly, saves the PNG to the correct path, and updates the frontmatter automatically.

**Manual / interactive** — for when the user wants to pick the pattern themselves. Always fill in the content type and slug from the file you just created:

```bash
npm run banner:pick mechanisms quadratic-funding
npm run banner:pick research my-article-slug
npm run banner:pick apps my-app-slug
```

Opens the Chladni generator in the user's browser. They set Aspect to Landscape, press R until happy, press S to save — the terminal comes back into focus automatically, the script moves the file to the right path, and updates the frontmatter.

> When generating multiple articles, run `npm run banner:auto` after creating all the files — it handles everything in one pass.

---

## Adding Content

### Preferred workflow (via GitHub Issues)

The publish scripts handle image downloading, path writing, and file creation automatically. Use these when possible:

```bash
npm run publish-app <issue-number>
npm run publish-mechanism <issue-number>
npm run publish-research <issue-number>
npm run publish-case-study <issue-number>
npm run publish-campaign <issue-number>
```

### Manual creation (what Claude should do)

1. Create the file at `src/content/{category}/{slug}.md`
2. Do **not** add `banner:` to the frontmatter — omit it entirely
3. After creating all content files, run:
   ```bash
   npm run banner:auto
   ```
   This finds every `.md` file without a `banner:` field, generates a banner using the Chladni Particles generator, saves the PNG to the correct path, and patches the frontmatter automatically. **Always run this after creating content files.**

> If `npm run banner:auto` fails with a Playwright error, the user needs to run `npx playwright install chromium` once (one-time setup per machine). Tell them to do this and then re-run the command.

### Slugs

- Kebab-case, derived from the content name
- Must match the filename exactly (`slug: quadratic-funding` → `quadratic-funding.md`)
- When updating an existing file, use the same slug as the existing file to avoid creating a duplicate
- Use existing slugs when referencing related content

### Tags

Lowercase, hyphen-separated. Follow existing conventions from similar files — e.g. `quadratic`, `retroactive`, `democratic`, `infrastructure`, `sybil-resistance`, `multichain`, `grants`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium  # one-time per machine — needed for banner generation
npm run dev                       # dev server
npm run build                     # production build
npm run lint
npm run sync-docs                 # sync content to OpenAI vector store for AI chat
```
